/*  
Welcome, new coder. 
Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!' 
to the console (the panel on the right)
*/

const { Console } = require("console")

console.log('"Hello, World!"')
console.log(1+2+3+4)
console.log("Hello, LaunchCode!\nThank you for helping me learn to code! :-)")

/*  
Next, PLAY! 
Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

   1. Change the message that is printed. I did this.
   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them? I get an unexpected string error when removing them.
   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")?
       Removing one results in a Syntax error. Must use quote marks. Must use the same type of quote mark, but in this case, using a single or double does not matter as long as they are the same.
   4. Remove the semi-colon, ;. Code still works in this case.
   5. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).Taking the quotes off allows for adding numbers.
   6. Print multiple messages one after the other. I repeated console.log on multiple lines.
   7. Print two messages on the same line. I think you do this by adding \n.
   8. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore". I added single quote marks around double quote marks.
   9. Other. You choose!
